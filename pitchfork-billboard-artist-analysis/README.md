# Analysis of Pitchfork Album Reviews & Billboard Hot 100 Rankings (by Artist)
[Pitchfork.com](https://pitchfork.com/) is one of the most respected opinions in the music industry when it comes to measuring how "good" an artist, album or song is. The [Billboard Hot 100](https://www.billboard.com/charts/hot-100/) is the most widely accepted ranking of song popularity in the US, updated weekly.

## Goal of the Project
I wanted to find out what artists fell into a so-called "sweet spot" of high Pitchfork ratings AND high Billboard ratings. At the same time, I also wanted to confirm the widely accepted belief that Pitchfork does NOT adhere to mainstream popularity and identify where Pitchfork typically ranks mainstream artists.

## Overview of Datasets
- #1 : Pitchfork Web Scraping Dataset (Album Reviews: 2017-2021)
-- This was started as part of an earlier project to analyze just the Pitchfork 
- #2 : Pitchfork Kaggle Dataset (Album Review: 1999-2017)
- #3 : Billboard Hot 100 Dataset (Weekly Rankings, All-Time)

## Goal of the Game
 - Win as much money as you can until you "crap" out by rolling a 7
 - Allowed 1 round of bets on all numbers before rolling, and the payouts for each outcome are calculated based on vegas odds
 - Keep rolling and winning until you roll a 7
