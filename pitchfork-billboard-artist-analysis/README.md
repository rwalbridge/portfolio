A simplified adaptation of vegas style craps built within Python using functional programming with 9 functions.

## Goal of the Game

 - Allowed 1 round of bets on all numbers before rolling, and the payouts for each outcome are calculated based on vegas odds
 - Keep rolling and winning until you roll a 7
